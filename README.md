# stepview
A mobile StepMania chart viewer!

# Why??
I recently got into the ~~beautiful and majestic~~ **really weird** ~~art~~ **addiction** of DDR! One of the first things I found was that I just couldn't comprehend what was happening on-screen; my brain wasn't used to the arrow positions and my body wasn't prepared to move the way it needed to. 

StepView is an endeavor to make it easy to load, play, and review StepMania charts (most likely DDR .sm files, you pirates) on your phone!
